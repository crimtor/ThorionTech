                We all have sort of a bucket list. One of mine was that I would one day fly first class.
                Now I don’t normally think in terms of paying more for a similar outcome,
                which really is what first class is all about.. paying for the experience,
                not the destination .It is touted as a a rich man’s thing.
                At least that’s the way that it is proposed on tv and movies.

  There is one thing that I hate more than anything, its the “f” word.
  You guessed it, fees! Now I’m not talking about the convenience fee for making a
   payment over the phone with a real person (although those are pesky as well, although avoidable),
    I’m talking about the ones you pay, often without even knowing it.

              McDonalds is pretty brilliant when it comes to their prices,

  do the same things that others do and save your cash doing it.  Its like ice cream.
   To me, vanilla is boring, I want the hot fudge, I want the nuts,
   I want whipped cream with a cherry on top, I even want it in a cone,
   but I want to pay less than the guy who just gets vanilla in a cup.
